I am a third-year software engineering student at the University of Canterbury. I'm looking for internships for the summer currently, with an interest in Full Stack development as I have a love for both the front and backend.

**What I'm currently up to:**
- This semester I'm taking a range of papers including Data and Network Security, Humans and Computers, Fundamentals of Engineering Economics and Management, and Software Engineering Project Workshop. I'm most interested currently in Software Engineering Project Workshop as we are working in groups of 6-7 throughout the entire semester to create a Java application. The application is centred around viewing and analysing Crash Data.
- In my spare time I'm learning more about web development and all the different frameworks and tools. I'm in the process of creating a developer portfolio website to showcase my projects and to get more practice with web design.
