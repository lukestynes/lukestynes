I'm a fourth-year software engineering student at the University of Canterbury. I'm currently working at Allied Telesis on a test automation project related to the testing of wireless routers.

I'm on the look out for internships in and around Wellington for the 2024/25 Summer, ideally working in a professional team doing FulL Stack Development.

**What I'm currently up to:**
- This semester I'm taking Advanced Topics in Security, Software Process and Product Quality, Computer Vision, and a full year Software Engineering Group Project. In our group projects we are working in teams of 8 to develop a web application aimed at home gardeners.
- In my spare time I'm learning more about web development and all the different frameworks and tools. I'm in the process of creating a developer portfolio website to showcase my projects and to get more practice with web design.
