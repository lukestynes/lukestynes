I am a software engineering student trying to find where I want to specialise and direct my career. I currently love all aspects of development and engineering and am open to anything.

**What I'm currently up to?**
- This semester I'm taking a range of papers including Databases, Imbedded Systems, Networking, and Discrete Math. There's some new languages to me coming up including C and SQL.
- In my personal time I am currently learning about Javascript and it's uses for development, including GatsbyJS. Also toying around with Django for Python to learn about creating full stack apps.
- Working on creating a web creative agency specialising in web design and brand consulting helping to push businesses lagging behind to embrace technology and enhance their digital identity.
- Running events for Entre, the University entrepeneurship club.
